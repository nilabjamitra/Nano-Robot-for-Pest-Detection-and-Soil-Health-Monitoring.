# Nano-Robot-for-Pest-Detection-and-Soil-Health-Monitoring.
Overview
This project is an IoT and Machine Learning-powered nano-robotic system designed for real-time soil health monitoring and automated pest detection in agriculture. By integrating advanced sensors and deep learning algorithms, this solution empowers farmers with actionable insights, enabling proactive, sustainable farm management and reducing reliance on chemical pesticides.

Features
Real-Time Soil Monitoring: Measures key soil health indicators using onboard sensors.

Automated Pest Detection: Employs deep learning models to identify and locate common agricultural pests.

Remote Data Visualization: Sends soil and pest data to a remote server/cloud, allowing farmers to monitor field conditions from anywhere.

Sustainable Farming: Supports optimized pesticide usage and sustainable agricultural practices.

Modular Design: Code and hardware can be customized for various crop/field requirements.

Technologies Used
Hardware: IoT-enabled nano-robotic platform, soil sensors, imaging sensors.

Software: Python, TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning), IoT libraries.

Communication: WiFi/Bluetooth for data transmission.

Deployment: Edge/Cloud computing for data aggregation and visualization.

Repository Structure
ImgRecCode.py, ImgRecModel.py, Image Rec2.py: Image recognition modules for pest detection.

SoilHealth.py: Soil sensor integration and data processing code.

TRIALCODE 2.py: Experimental trial scripts.

LICENSE: Project license information.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+

Required Python libraries (see Requirements)

IoT hardware setup (nano-robot, sensors)

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/nilabjamitra/Nano-Robot-for-Pest-Detection-and-Soil-Health-Monitoring.git
cd Nano-Robot-for-Pest-Detection-and-Soil-Health-Monitoring
Install required dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Create a requirements.txt with the necessary Python packages.)

Hardware Setup
Assemble the nano-robot with soil and image sensors.

Connect your device to WiFi/Bluetooth for data transmission.

Usage
Run soil monitoring:

bash
python SoilHealth.py
Run pest detection module:

bash
python ImgRecCode.py
For model training or testing, inspect individual scripts as needed.

Data will be transmitted to the remote server for visualization and analytics.
